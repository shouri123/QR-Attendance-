## 📌 Smart Attendance System with QR Code

A Flask-based smart attendance system that uses **QR codes** to mark student attendance in real time and integrates with **Google Sheets** to automatically update records.  

👉 The unique part? Once attendance is done, scanning the **STOP QR** will stop the process and trigger an email with the **latest updated Google Sheet** attached.

## 🚀 How it Works  

1. **Scan Student QR Code**  
   - Each student’s QR code contains their unique link.  
   - Open the link in a browser → attendance is marked in Google Sheet.  

2. **Attendance Confirmation**  
   - After scanning, you’ll see a web page confirming that attendance has been recorded.  

3. **Repeat for All Students**  
   - Continue scanning each student’s QR code until all are marked.  

4. **Scan STOP QR** 
   - Once all students are marked, scan the special **STOP QR code**.  
   - This will stop the attendance process.  

5. **Email Sent Automatically**  
   - The system sends an email with the **updated Google Sheet** attached.  
   - You can download and view the attendance directly from your inbox.
